# Advent of Code 2024 #
Second time attempting AoC, using this repository to track progress in becoming comfortable with my language of choice.

### As this progresses there will be a new directory for each day that generally follows the format: ###

- dayNum
- input.txt
- README.md

Where the README is a summerization of that days goal
input.txt will be the given data for that days challenge
dayNum will be the main file in whichever chosen language to solve that days challenge
