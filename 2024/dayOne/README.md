- Take your input.txt file and separate each column into some data structure, array for me
- Sort your two arrays from lowest value to highest
- Compare both arrays at similar indices and take the absolute value of the difference of the values
- Once that abs( difference ) is complete take the sum of all those results
- The sum of all is your answer for day one.
